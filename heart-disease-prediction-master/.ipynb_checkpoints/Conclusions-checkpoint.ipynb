For this case study, I deemed that it was more dangerous to return a false negative, because the consequence could be that a sick patient does not receive the medical treatment they need. With that said, it would be advantageous to learn more about how this prediction model might actually be used in practice and other possible consequences, which would help further inform my algorithm choice."
